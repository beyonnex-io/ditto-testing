# Eclipse Dittoâ„¢ Testing

This repository contains the "system tests" of Eclipse Ditto.  
They ensure that on API level no regressions happen, that APIs stay stable and that added functionality is tested 
from a user perspective.

## How to run tests in IntelliJ

System tests require the following components to run.
1. Containers required by Ditto stack (MongoDB) and by connectivity tests (Mosquitto, Artemis etc.).
2. A working Ditto stack, either as docker stack or launched from IntelliJ.
3. A local [authorization server mock](#authorization-server-mock).

### Start MongoDB and message broker containers

If you want to launch Ditto from IntelliJ, start the MongoDB container:
```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d mongodb
```
If you want to run Ditto as a docker stack, simply run `docker/start.sh`. MongoDB is included.

Connectivity tests require message brokers. Start them thus:
```bash
cd docker

# AMQP broker
docker-compose up -d artemis

# MQTT broker
docker-compose up -d mqtt

# Kafka broker
docker-compose up -d kafka

# RabbitMQ broker
docker-compose up -d rabbitmq
```
The brokers do consume system resources. Start them on a by-need basis.

### Run Ditto

To run Ditto as a docker stack, simply execute `docker/start.sh`. MongoDB is included.

To launch Ditto from IntelliJ, in debug mode for instance, run 
[`Policies`](intelliJRunConfigurations/Policies%20for%20test.run.xml) first and the other required
services after. A launch sequence could look like this:
1. [`Policies`](intelliJRunConfigurations/Policies%20for%20test.run.xml)
2. [`Things`](intelliJRunConfigurations/Things%20for%20test.run.xml)
3. [`Search`](intelliJRunConfigurations/ThingsSearch%20for%20test.run.xml)
4. [`Connectivity`](intelliJRunConfigurations/Connectivity%20for%20test.run.xml)
5. [`Gateway`](intelliJRunConfigurations/Gateway%20for%20test.run.xml)

Or, simply make use of the [multirun plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7248-multirun) for which a 
[run configuration](intelliJRunConfigurations/Ditto4test.run.xml) also is available.

## Authorization server mock

Tests authenticate themselves via OAuth against a mock server.  
The tests make use of the [mock-oauth2-server](https://github.com/navikt/mock-oauth2-server).

In order to run it, simply start it via compose:
```bash
cd docker

# OAuth mock server
docker-compose up -d oauth
``
